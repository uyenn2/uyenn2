ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Uyen. I'm interested in using data analytics to improve efficiency and user experiences. Currently, I'm the Electronic Resources and Discovery Librarian at Duke University Medical Center Library, where I manage our library electronic collection, troubleshoot access problems for our patrons and creating library magic daily.
